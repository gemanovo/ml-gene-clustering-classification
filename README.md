# Gene Expression Clustering with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project developed during my MSc studies, focused on unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression data using Python.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to explore and compare different clustering methods applied to high-dimensional biological data. The analysis workflow includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and evaluation of results.

The clustering methods implemented are:
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **K-Means**
- **DBSCAN**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**

Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** is applied to facilitate visualization and improve clustering performance in high-dimensional data.

## Data Privacy
Due to academic restrictions and data privacy, the original dataset cannot be shared.  

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling with `scikit-learn` Pipelines  
- Handling categorical and numerical data in a unified workflow  
- Application of multiple unsupervised learning algorithms  
- Model evaluation using **Silhouette Score** and **BIC**  
- Dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional datasets  
- Writing reproducible, well-documented, and clean Python code
